# Data-Structures

This Repository Will contain solutions to many problems of the data structures : my learning curve and practices with Both JS and Python in Parallel.
Every Data Structure folder will have relevant titles and folders where both the JS code and Python Code will be present as a solution. 

I will be adding anchor links to the question that I am solving to that particular folder as list mentioned below. Will be keep updating the lists as much as I can. Enjoy Learning Folks.
